          Excel Scrims is a community platform dedicated to organizing
          competitive Fortnite scrims. Our verification system uses Epic Account
          Services login to ensure that every player participating in our scrims
          is verified and authentic.

          event organizers. We provide a structured and secure environment for

          Why We Use Epic Login
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We use Epic Account Services (AES) login to verify all players who
          join our custom matches. This prevents impersonation, helps enforce
          rules, and ensures a level playing field. No Epic credentials are
          stored â€” all authentication is handled securely by Epic Games.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Get Started</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
